## Summary
The calculator application was challenging but also enjoyable to build. I dove head first into the design by creating a forEach
loop for the number values as well as the operators. This allowed me to create a nodeList by giving similar button elements the same 
class name, and subsequently calling them with querySelectorAll. When the button events occured the correct values were captured and 
passed along and stored in the DOM as necessary. The calculator had many moving parts, and I had to figure out how to put it all together.

The flow of the calculator required multiple functions to be called at different times, and there were many conditional statements 
that fired off at different times, which made it difficult to understand the timing of it all. I elevated my development skills by 
learning to use the debugger, which made it much more clear how the events got fired and in what order. Getting the correct logic
for continuous functionality was a cool feature I had fun implementing. Overall building the calculator was awesome and helped me build
and sharpen my skillset for development.
